## 🧠 The Problem
Traditional GitHub search relies on keywords. If you search for "fast backend with login", you might miss a revolutionary repository called "HyperVault" simply because it doesn't use your specific keywords in its title or tags. 

**GitHub Idea Matcher** uses Semantic Search (Vector Embeddings) to understand the *meaning* of your request, matching it against the deep technical context found in thousands of repository READMEs.

## ✨ Features
- **Semantic Mapping**: Uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to map natural language ideas to the high-dimensional vector space of GitHub descriptions.
- **Persistent Local Intelligence**: Powered by ChromaDB for local vector storage—no cloud required for MVP.
- **Intelligent Ingestion**: A dedicated pipeline that cleans markdown, removes noisy badges, and chunks READMEs to capture the "soul" of an idea.
- **Language Filtering**: Multi-dimensional filtering to find the right tool in the right ecosystem (Python, Rust, etc.).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites (Test Machine)
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed on your test machine. Note: This project is designed to run its heavy ML workloads on dedicated lab hardware.

### 2. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suzaykid/github-semantic-searcher.git
cd github-semantic-searcher
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
```

### 4. Data Ingestion
Populate your local vector database with real GitHub data:
```bash
python data_ingestion.py
```

### 5. Launch the Matcher
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
