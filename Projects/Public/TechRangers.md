TechRangers is a state-of-the-art spatial intelligence framework engineered to **digitize, verify, map, and optimize the implementation of the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006**. Designed for the complex socio-ecological landscapes of Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, and Telangana, the system bridges the gap between historical paper-based land claims and targeted, data-driven sustainable development.

## ⚡ Core Technical Pillars

### 1. Deep Semantic Segmentation (U-Net CNN)
*   **Neural Network Architecture:** Utilizes a custom **U-Net CNN** built in PyTorch. The model features 4 symmetric downsampling (encoder) and upsampling (decoder) blocks coupled with skip connections to retain high-frequency spatial boundaries during deep feature extraction.
*   **Loss Function Strategy:** Optimized using a hybrid **BCE + Dice Loss** function to handle highly imbalanced geographic datasets (e.g., small farm patches or narrow water streams against large forest tracts).
*   **Vectorization & Post-Processing:** Translates predicted pixel-level raster masks into vectorized geometries (`GeoJSON` / `WKT` polygons) using GDAL, saving the physical boundaries directly to PostGIS spatial tables.

### 2. OCR & Named Entity Recognition (NER)
*   **Document Digitization:** Extracts structured information from scanned historical FRA paper claims and certificates.
*   **Entity Extraction:** Employs spaCy and fine-tuned Transformer-based NER models to isolate critical fields: `patta_holder_name`, `village_name`, geographic coordinates, claimed area, and claim status.
*   **Asynchronous Queuing:** Managed by Celery task queues backed by Redis to support high-throughput document scanning.

### 3. Spatial PostGIS & Materialized View Optimization
*   **Normalized Geospatial Schema:** Relates foundational hierarchies (`states`, `districts`, `villages`) to environmental factors (`forest_data`, `groundwater_data`, `infrastructure_data`) via spatial keys.
*   **Pre-computed Spatial Joins:** Rather than executing heavy spatial overlap queries (`ST_Contains`, `ST_DWithin`, `ST_Distance`) on-the-fly, a high-performance **Materialized View (`village_dss_data`)** pre-computes indices including forest cover percentages, nearest groundwater tables, and road connectivity.
*   **Fast Queries:** Speeds up DSS queries, yielding sub-millisecond query execution speeds on regional datasets.

### 4. Rule-Based + AI-Enhanced DSS
*   **Central Sector Scheme (CSS) Layering:** Evaluates structural indices against policy rules to determine village-level and individual eligibility for programs like **PM-KISAN**, **Jal Jeevan Mission**, **MGNREGA**, and **DAJGUA**.
*   **Asset-based Intervention Priority:** If a village exhibits a critically low water index, the DSS flags the sector for targeted borewell installations under Jal Shakti, generating a policy recommendation backed by empirical data.
*   **AI Policy Clustering:** Runs K-Means clustering on multi-dimensional asset vectors to group villages into operational categories (e.g., highly forested with low road access vs. agricultural with high water risk), enabling precise resource distribution.

### 5. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration
*   **Agent-Ready Geospatial API:** Exposes the entire spatial database, U-Net inference triggers, and DSS recommendation algorithms to AI agents (like Claude or Gemini) via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
*   **Natural Language Spatial Inquiries:** Enables city administrators and planners to ask complex geographic questions (e.g., *"Show me all villages in Odisha eligible for Jal Jeevan Mission that have less than 15% forest cover"*), which the system automatically resolves via dynamic database lookups and returns as structured map overlays.

## 📂 Repository Layout

*   `/cv_models`: The semantic segmentation engine, containing the U-Net architecture, training pipelines, data pre-processors, and containerized Docker environments.
*   `/dss`: The analytical heart of the system, including PostGIS connectors, the rules engine, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.
*   `dss_schema.sql` / `dss_materialized_view.sql`: Database definition scripts for table architectures and index pre-computations.
*   `import_district_boundaries.py` (and related scripts): Geospatial import scripts that parse shapefiles and populate PostGIS tables.
*   `kmeans_clustering.py`: Unsupervised machine learning models to cluster and profile villages based on social and natural resources.

## 🚀 Dev Setup & Spatial Ingest

### 1. Install System Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ and PostgreSQL (with the PostGIS extension) installed.

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment & Packages
Clone the repository and install all required geospatial and deep learning libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seeramsujay/TechRangers.git
cd TechRangers
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize the Spatial Database
Initialize your PostGIS database and run the schema setup scripts:

```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres -f dss_schema.sql
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres -f dss_materialized_view.sql
```

### 4. Import Foundational GIS Boundaries
Run the import scripts to ingest administrative boundaries into PostGIS:

```bash
python import_state_boundaries.py
python import_district_boundaries.py
python import_village_boundaries.py
```

### 5. Run U-Net Training (Optional)
To train the satellite image semantic segmentation model:

```bash
python cv_models/train.py --data_dir /path/to/satellite/images
```

### 6. Launch the FastAPI REST & MCP Servers
Start the local server to serve REST APIs and the Model Context Protocol:

```bash
python dss/dss_api.py
```
This spins up:
*   **REST API:** `http://localhost:8000` (exposing endpoints like `/api/dss/recommendations`)
*   **MCP Protocol Server:** Running concurrently, allowing smart-city dashboards and AI agents to query the system using natural language.
