> **"Hardware is hard, but it shouldn't be silent."**

**SpecRAG** is a high-precision firmware validation engine that bridges the "semantic gap" between 1,000-page hardware datasheets and your C/C++ firmware. It uses a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server to inject real-time register-level intelligence directly into your IDE, catching fatal violations before they ever reach a PCB.

## 📑 The Silent Failure Problem
Embedded C/C++ compilers are excellent at catching syntax errors, but they are blind to hardware intent. A developer can write clean, valid C++ that:
- Writes to **Read-Only** memory-mapped registers.
- Uses an incorrect **I2C/SPI slave address**.
- Violates **timing constraints** (e.g., reading a sensor before its 100ms startup delay).
- Configures **clock bitmasks** that unintentionally disable critical peripherals.

These errors lead to weeks of oscilloscope debugging or, worse, charred silicon. SpecRAG moves these "Runtime Disasters" to "Compile-time Squiggles."

## 🚀 Key Innovation: The SpecRAG Stack

### 1. Zero-Hallucination RAG
SpecRAG doesn't rely on the LLM's internal (and often outdated) knowledge of hardware. It uses a custom **RAG Pipeline** (Node 1) to retrieve the exact table or register description from the component's **PDF Datasheet** and feeds it as "Ground Truth" to the auditor.

### 2. Structured Output Guarantee (Pydantic)
Using **Gemini 1.5 Flash's Structured Output API** and **Pydantic** models, SpecRAG mathematically guarantees that the auditor's response is valid JSON. It cannot return "conversational fluff"—only actionable data for the VS Code UI.

### 3. MCP Decoupling
By using the **Model Context Protocol**, the "Brain" (AI) is completely decoupled from the "Body" (IDE). You can run the SpecRAG server on a powerful lab machine while coding on a lightweight laptop.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- At least one LLM API key:
  - **Gemini API Key** (Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`)
  - **Azure OpenAI API Key** (Set `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` in `.env`)
  - **OpenAI API Key** (Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`)

### 2. Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suzaykid/specRAG.git
cd specRAG
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env      # Or configure the created .env directly
```

### 3. Usage
Run the MCP server locally over stdio:
```bash
# Recommended: Runs via Server.py which automatically loads .env configuration
python Server.py
```

### 4. VS Code Extension Installation (Node 4 Client)
Since this is a desktop IDE extension, the deployment artifact is a compiled `.vsix` file.

**To install the extension:**
1. Download the compiled `specrag-vscode-0.1.0.vsix` file from the **GitHub Releases** assets (or use the locally generated file at `extension/specrag-vscode-0.1.0.vsix`).
2. Open VS Code.
3. Go to the Extensions View (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
4. Click the `...` menu button in the top-right corner of the Extensions panel.
5. Select **Install from VSIX...** from the dropdown menu.
6. Select the downloaded `.vsix` file to install it.

**Configuration Settings:**
After installing, adjust the extension settings in VS Code (`specrag.*`):
*   `specrag.pythonPath`: Set to the path of your virtual environment's Python binary (e.g., `/path/to/specRAG/venv/bin/python3`).
*   `specrag.serverPath`: Set to the absolute path of `Server.py` in this repository (e.g., `/path/to/specRAG/Server.py`).
*   `specrag.useMock`: Toggle to `true` to run dry-run mock validation checks offline without querying the live LLM.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Status
- [x] **P1: Foundation**: MCP SDK Server shell & Protocol definition.
- [x] **P2: Deep Build**: LLM integrations (Gemini, Azure OpenAI, OpenAI) & System Prompt engineering.
- [x] **P3: Integration**: Dynamic RAG retriever hook, mock fallback, and exception handling.
- [x] **P4: Polish**: Server wrapper entry point (`Server.py`) & environment variables (`.env`).
